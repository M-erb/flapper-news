Tutorial found on https://thinkster.io

Went through this a few times and cannot seem to find out where I am going wrong on teh comments page. For some reasons the upvotes are not working there.
##FIXED!
I think I simply just have not gotten to that part of the tutorial yet but I added a incrementUpvotes function but for comments in the PostsCtrl controller and it works great now.
